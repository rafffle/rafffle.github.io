<p>Below is a list of textbooks I have used, and some of my thoughts on them. I tend to like rigorous, dry, and to-the-point books in mathematics, while physics, I enjoy standard texts. The reviews are a work in progress, and some of the really big books (Rising Sea, Mirror Symmetry and Foundations of Mechanics) I am still reading (and have been reading for a while).</p>

  <summary>Éléments des mathématiques, livre II: algèbre by Bourbaki (3rd ed.)</summary>
    Clarté: ★★★<br>
    Difficulté: ★★★★★<br>
    Overall: ★★★★★<br>
    It's Bourbaki, need I say more? Really, though, this book (series) really wow'ed me. It's really beautifully written. As Bourbaki does, it's extremely thorough. I read a relatively old edition (from 1962)—Dr. Post let me take them from some old book pile that was laying in the math department faculty lounge at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa. I spent a whole summer reading it, because I thought it would be cool to learn in French from the "real thing". Ironically, when I got to college, I had "knowledge gaps"—a UFD, to me, was known as an "anneau factoriel" (which literally translates to "factorial ring"), so my brain had some trouble adjusting to the terminology. But overall, I think the hard work to read the full book and do its exercises was beyond worth it. Would I do it for another Bourbaki book? Probably not, it really does take quite some time. But I think there's something quite beautiful in the way they constructed algebra (starting with "internal composition laws" and working up), definitely not what you would get from other graduate texts like Lang or Godement.

  <summary>Introduction to Abstract Algebra by Dummit & Foote (3rd ed.)</summary>
    Clarity: ★★★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★★★<br>
    Overall: ★★★<br>
    This book was used in my MATH 171 class with Prof. Lindo at Mudd. We only did parts I and II (group teory and ring theory). I think the true value of the book is in the exercises, which are not too hard, but just enough to get you to understand what you have to understand and how to work with it. Otherwise, since I had read Bourbaki before taking the class, the book itself was not too interesting (but don't take my word for it).

  <summary>Linear Algebra & Its Applications by Lay, Lay, & McDonald (6th ed.)</summary>
    Clarity: ★★★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★<br>
    Overall: ★★★<br>
    Standard linear algebra textbook that Mr. Hue used in his linear algebra class at ʻIolani. I don't have much to say on it. I already knew some linear algebra going into the class (from quantum mechanics), but I had not learned it the "traditional way" (i.e. spending a whole lot of time on row reduction and then doing a bunch of proofs) and instead just knew what a physics major needs to know and nothing more (i.e. to do what you need to do in quantum mechanics). Needless to say that learning it the traditional way was much more helpful than my physics knowledge, because when it came time for the Math 073 placement test at Mudd, I would not have gotten by without having gone through this book.

  <summary>Numerical Analysis by Burden & Faires (9th ed.)</summary>
    Clarity: ★★★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★★<br>
    Overall: ★★★<br>
    This book was used in my MATH 165 class with Prof. Haddock at Mudd. She based her lectures on these, and we Trefethen and Bau's book on numerical linear algebra to supplement. As Prof. Haddock said on one of the first slides on the first day, this course was on numerical linear algebra (perhaps this would have been better placed in the above section?) A lot of it was on fixed point methods, and overall I found the course and content material pretty fun. As for the textbook, it reminds me of modern calculus/differential equations/linear algebra textbooks in that it's very example-motivated and exercise-heavy; though I'd argue that the exercises weren't too enlightening, as they were mostly just plugging in numbers/equations into the methods covered in the chapter. They were good for getting comfortable with working with those methods. The book definitely served as good motivation to look deeper into the theory.

<summary>Systèmes différentiels et méthode des éléments finis by Jeribi</summary>
    Clarté: ★<br>
    Difficulté: ★★★★<br>
    Overall: ★★★<br>
    I picked up this book in Paris; I have family in Normandy, and was staying with them, but my father was going back home early, so I used that as an excuse to go to Paris with him and get some cool books. I saw a big stack of these green <i>Calvage et Mounet</i> books. All were quite new. A friend had recently told me to look into FEA, so I grabbed the FEA book because it looked interesting. Unfortunately, this book is unclear on its prerequisites (lots of functional analysis) and its first chapters are honestly a bit messy (weird sequences of statements, typos)—it seemed like the author wanted to put together a "bare minimum" quickly, but he didn't give it enough attention, in my opinion. The rest of the book, though, got me really engaged in the field.

  <summary>Calculus on manifolds by Spivak</summary>
    Clarity: ★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★★★<br>
    Overall: ★★★★<br>
    This dense little book was an interesting read. It was quite an enjoyable and elegant ride to get to the general Stokes theorem, though there's very little motivation. It's very brief, and only gives you the information it needs to tell you, which might come at the cost of conceptual understanding for those who struggle with the style. Following the style, I'll say no more.

  <summary>Understanding analysis by Abbott (1st ed.)</summary>
    Clarity: ★★★★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★★<br>
    Overall: ★★★★★<br>
    This was the first proofs-heavy book that I'd read. I think this is the best and clearest gentle introduction to mathematical analysis of a single variable. It's very readable and friendly when comparing to other undergraduate texts like Rudin. It covers all the standard topics of a one-semester course, but, as the [MAA review](https://old.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/understanding-analysis) puts it well, discusses them in a nonstandard way, in a way that is dangerous to the instructor because it is so well-written and well-motivated that book's exposition will almost always exceed an instructor's lectures in clarity. The exercises were particularly well-chosen to advance the reader's understanding and comfort with the material.

  <summary>Calculus with analytic geometry (2nd ed.)</summary>
    Clarity: ★★★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★★★<br>
    Overall: ★★★★★<br>
    Easily my favorite book of all time, but perhaps due to my personal connection with it more than anything else. My grandfather studied chemical engineering in the Philippines. He passed away before I was born. I was always curious about him, the person he was, and the things that he did. When I was about 9, I was visiting my grandmother in the Philippines, and she let me look through the book collection and take some things. This thick, orange, book caught my eye. On the first page, it said, "Romeo D. Esquivel". I knew I had to take it. It was this very book that got me interested in studying mathematics beyond the grade school level. It's quite old-school. It covers three semester's worth of calculus, starting with a thorough introduction to the prerequisite algebra and jumping into the epsilon-delta definition of limits. It then goes all the way up to standard multivariable calculus concepts. It took me over 2 years to go thrugh the book and its exercises; I brought it with me everywhere I would go. It was truly special to me. When I took AP Calculus BC in school, I could not find any enjoyment in the style of any authors of any books that the AP courses used, but maybe that's because I'm biased.

  <summary>Partial differential equations by John (1st ed.)</summary>
    Clarity: ★★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★★★★<br>
    Overall: ★★★<br>
    Picked up this old book at the library to study for a placement test at Mudd. It explains the characteristic method particularly well. It bridges the gap in rigor that Pinchover & Rubinstein's book sort of glazes over.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>An introduction to partial differential equations by Pinchover & Rubinstein</summary>
    Clarity: ★★★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★★★<br>
    Overall: ★★★★<br>
    Used this to study for a placement test at Mudd, aiming to fill in the knowledge gaps that I had, having studied partial differential equations mostly from Boas (see below). Quite well-motivated, and it provides a good conceptual understanding for the methods in PDEs used at the undergraduate level.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Mathematical methods in the physical sciences by Boas (3rd ed.)</summary>
    Clarity: ★★★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★★<br>
    Overall: ★★★★<br>
    I used this for PHY 302 at ASU with Prof. Vachaspati. I put this under "differential equations" because the main use of this book was to gain familiarity with PDE techniques used in undergraduate physics, especially special functions and Sturm-Liouville theory. Boas gives a well-motivated exposition and walks you through the subject quite well.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Differential equations with boundary-value problems by Zill & Cullen (5th ed.)</summary>
    Clarity: ★★★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★<br>
    Overall: ★★★<br>
    I used this book in my ordinary differential equations class at ʻIolani with Dr. Cottrell and Dr. Lomuscio. This book is standard. It feels a little mechanical and boring, just teaching you some basic techniques to solving certain types of differential equations, but it does its job.

<h2 id="discrete-mathematics">Discrete mathematics</h2>
<details>
  <summary>Discrete mathematics, an open introduction by Oscar Levin (4th ed.)</summary>
    Clarity: ★★★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★★★<br>
    Overall: ★★★<br>
    I read this to study for a placement at Mudd. Well-motivated, but a bit longer than it should be, in my opinion.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>A TeXas Style introduction to proof by Taylor & Rault</summary>
    Clarity: ★★★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★<br>
    Overall: ★★★★<br>
    I used this book in my discrete mathematics class at ʻIolani with Dr. Lomuscio. Dr. Lomuscio went to Berry College for his undergrad, so he got us this book written by a Berry professor that I had never heard of. Honestly, I think it's an excellent introduction to proof writing techniques and the type of rigor higher math courses want, without overwhelming the reader with too many new, hard concepts. Highly recommend for any high school discrete math/proofs class.

  <summary>Geometry, topology, and physics by Nakahara (2nd ed.)</summary>
    Clarity: ★★★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★★★★<br>
    Overall: ★★★★★<br>
    This is how I originally learned differential geometry and the other sorts of things a physics student needs to study beyond basic undergraduate things. This book is exceptionally well-motivated, giving just enough for the physics student to retain (and even develop) an interest in the math. The first chapter is a beautiful amuse-bouche for mathematical physics, and the 13th and 14th chapters finish the feast with a sweet touch of physics that got me passionate about this subject.

  <summary>The rising sea: foundations of algebraic geometry</summary>
    Clarity: ★★★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★★★★★<br>
    Overall: ★★★★★<br>
    This was the book used in an independent reading course in algebraic geometry (titled "scheme theory") with Prof. Karp at Mudd. While Vakil makes you work for it, the book itself (or, at least, the first two parts that I have read so far—it's a work in progress for me) is incredibly rewarding, more so than Hartshorne. You have to work to understand things. The exercises are beautifully selected and the important ones are highlighted. Vakil's book is truly one of a kind, and I can't see it going out of fashion for a while.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>The geometry of schemes by Eisenbud</summary>
    Clarity: ★★★★<br>
    Difficulty: ★★★★<br>
    Overall: ★★★★<br>
    An excellent supplement to Vakil's book for understanding schemes, especially from a geometric standpoint.

  <summary>Algebraic geometry by Hartshorne</summary>
